# PokemonDemo_DaggerStartingPoint
This is the starting point of Dagger Tutorials, You can download this project and then can move along with the tutorials that I will record and update on my youtbue channel soon.
- This is a demo app that will fetch Pokemon details and show it in RecyclerView.
- This package consists of 5 packages
  * adapter - Package to hold RecyclerView Adapters
  * api - Package to hold interface related to Retrofit or any other file related to Api Calls
  * classes - Packge to hold all the Activity or application classes
  * holder - Package to hold all the RecyclerView Holders
  * model - Package to hold model objects or in simple words we can put it as response that we get from our API
- I have kept this project as simple as I can. I could have used MVP in order to code this, but I am thinking to create another series of video tutorials in which I'll create this app from scratch using MVP, RxJava, Dagger2 and all the modern technologies that we use these days in Android. I will also show you how to test your application using that project.
